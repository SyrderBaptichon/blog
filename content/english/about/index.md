# About Me

My name is **Syrder Baptichon**, and I'm passionate about **programming**, **networking**, and **DevOps**. I currently hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Le Havre Normandie.

Curious, meticulous, and highly motivated, I develop my skills through hands-on projects that involve software development, network administration, security, and automation. I have a particular interest in continuous integration, infrastructure as code, and the management of complex technical environments all key areas where DevOps truly comes to life.

# About This Website

This website was created as a personal space to **share my learning journey**, showcase my **projects**, and reflect on **DevOps, programming**, and everything related to computer science.

I use it primarily to write technical articles, document my experiments both successes and failures and put into words what I learn through my studies, readings, and personal or professional projects.

It serves as a **technical journal**, a **toolbox**, and a way to **make my knowledge accessible** to other students, enthusiasts, and curious minds in the field.

The goal isnâ€™t to be exhaustive or perfect, but to be honest, useful, and constantly evolving just like my own journey.
